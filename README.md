## Design Choices


### Server
- Nodejs. Later on typescript.

### Primary data store
- Mongodb. Not sure if this would be the best choice when it comes to full text search, or performing analytics to gain insights into decision making processes.

## Search engine
- Use Elasticsearch as the document store
